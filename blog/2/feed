 <title>Urban Heat Risks</title>
 <link>https://www.aaiforesight.com/blog/urban-heat-risks</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-picture-for-slideshow field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-and-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.aaiforesight.com/sites/default/files/styles/rectangle-368px-wide/public/thermometer-gd_sm_0.jpg?itok=4Lrwrgvf&quot; width=&quot;368&quot; height=&quot;307&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;credit: Gerd Altmann / Pixabay&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-holder&quot; style=&quot;width:368px; max-width:100% !important;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;credit: Gerd Altmann / Pixabay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;While it has long been a given that global populations have been migrating to cities, and more recently that climate change is increasing average temperatures, weather scientists are now putting the two trends together to raise concerns about the increase in urban heat-related illnesses and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What have been called “urban heat islands” occur when the growth of cities replaces natural land cover with dense concentrations of pavement, buildings, and other surfaces that absorb and retain heat. This effect increases energy costs (e.g., for air conditioning), air pollution levels, and heat-related illness and mortality.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The built environment of roads, buildings, and centralized infrastructure (especially concrete and asphalt) absorbs solar energy and radiates it around the clock. In a public health context, this pattern is complicated by the difficulty in correctly diagnosing for heat-illness and related deaths, as heat can contribute to and amplify existing negative health conditions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another complicating factor is the wide range of variance of “hot spots” across any large city. Factors involved include variances between upper- and lower-income neighborhoods, with structures in richer areas more likely to have mitigating technologies such as effective insulation and air conditioning. As well, vegetation such as tree plantings and parks have a substantial cooling effect by releasing water vapor during photosynthesis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition, tall buildings block cooling air circulation, and their building materials (brick, wood. etc.) each store and release heat differently. In climate science, air temperature is typically measured in the shade, while being in the open sun can have a dramatically greater impact on the human body. In fact, a measurement technology called RealFeel has been developed that incorporates factors such as cloud cover, sun angle, and humidity (and the latter is the most critical in human response to heat, both in terms of personal perception and actual health impact).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Edith de Guzman of the Los Angeles Cooling Collaborative says that the young and the elderly are most at risk in extreme heat events (which are becoming more common each year) because their bodies have less effective thermo-regulation. Also, conditions such as asthma increase the danger from heat domes such as the one that occurred in the northwestern U.S. from late June until mid-July in 2021.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Vivek Shandas, a climate adaptation scientist at Portland State University in Oregon, found that, during that dramatic event, air-conditioned homes were kept at 75 degrees F. while temperatures in homes without soared to as much as 125 degrees. He also found that, in many cities, low-income urban areas had less investment in green spaces and more occurrence of freeways and heat-absorbing infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Although climate scientists are still challenged in accurately modeling variations in micro-climates within cities and among cities in the U.S. and globally, some overarching strategies seem to have promise. However, the overall view is negative. According to Dr. Kristie Ebi at the University of Washington Center for Health and the Global Environment in Seattle, “It is definitive that we are already seeing an increase in the frequency, intensity and duration of heat waves. The projections are that this escalation will continue across the U.S.” And the cooling industry is adding to the problem. It accounts for 10% of global CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, and air conditioning’s demand on electric power plants is projected to triple by 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;De Guzman suggests that in these changing times, heat management should be seen as a public health issue, which might be approached with better methods of recognizing heat cramps, heat exhaustion, and heat stroke. As well, increasing tree plantings and painting roofs lighter colors would assist urban areas in managing the problem. Greater understanding of urban heat island effects and impact can offer positive responses to a world that is not getting any cooler for the near and perhaps far future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example, it is estimated that the 2021 northwestern heat dome—which would previously have been a “1,000 year” severe weather event—was made 150 more times more likely by climate change, resulting in the highest temperature ever measured in Canada (120 degrees F). NOAA estimated that heat dome related damages ran to $9 billion, including flooding from snowmelt, rail and road infrastructure meltdown, extensive crop loss, and wildfires (one completely destroying the Canadian town of Lytton, British Columbia—the site of the above heat record). The New York Times estimated at least 600 deaths can be directly linked to heat in Canada alone—in both urban and rural areas—and over 1,000 region-wide. In addition, over 3,000 emergency medical team calls were directly tied to extreme heat in the Pacific Northwest over that three-week period.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These above examples provide weight to the conclusion that, while urban heat sinks are likely to worsen, climate change and extreme weather will add to their severity. But the question remains—as has been true of climate change generally—is whether viable response strategies will be developed and then implemented effectively worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Orbital Issues: Space Junk</title>
 <link>https://www.aaiforesight.com/blog/orbital-issues-space-junk</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-picture-for-slideshow field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-and-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.aaiforesight.com/sites/default/files/styles/rectangle-368px-wide/public/leo-2019-1024_NASA-ODPO_Low%20Earth%20Orbit.jpg?itok=X4Dp-ZEw&quot; width=&quot;368&quot; height=&quot;368&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Low Earth Orbit debris.

Credit: NASA Orbital Debris Program Office&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;While space is too vast to imagine, and there are few who are actually capable of littering there, the orbital space surrounding our own planet is considerably smaller. In recent years, the number of launches and functional objects in low Earth orbit (LEO) have increased dramatically, and the amount of orbital trash from a variety of sources has grown at an even greater rate. Meanwhile, strategies to deal with potential problems in this arena are still problematic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crash of a Chinese rocket launched in 2014 into the far side of the Moon was not a trivial event, as it weighed in at nearly forty metric tons. In addition, the China Space Station had close encounters in July and October of 2021 with Starlink satellites launched by SpaceX, thus highlighting the growing orbital presence of the private sector. In response to complaints about the management of the more than 1,500 satellites SpaceX now has in orbit, CEO Elon Musk countered, “Space is just extremely enormous and satellites are very tiny,” thus highlighting the fact that few private sector players are active participants in orbital problem solving.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Georgetown University law professor David Koplow notes that many private satellites are not very maneuverable and thus are likely to stay in orbit long beyond their functional life. Although telecommunications satellites in geosynchronous equatorial obits (GEO) are assigned stable slots by the International Telecommunications Union (ITU), most LEO satellites are traveling at close to 17,000 miles per hour with an average of 1,000 new ones being placed in LEO space annually. At the beginning of 2022, the Union of Concerned Scientists counted 4,852 live satellites and nearly 3,000 defunct ones in Earth orbit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;More concerning are the 22,000 objects over 4 inches in size tracked by the U.S. Space Surveillance Network and the more than half million smaller rocket parts, scrap, and collision debris. For example, the International Space Station (ISS) has had to adjust its orbit to avoid collisions with debris over 30 times in the past 20 years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For science fiction fans, the David Brin novel &lt;i&gt;Existence&lt;/i&gt; (2012) predicted the development of a space scrap recycling industry, using poly-fiber lassos, and presently startups using nets, magnets, lassos, and even a giant claw are in the works. That giant claw, called ClearSpace-1, is a project of the European Space Agency (ESA) (working from a budget of 120 million euros), scheduled to launch in 2025 to pull a 220-pound piece from a 2013 ESA launch out of orbit, thus allowing it to burn up in reentry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, not all reentry events are so benign, such as the Russian satellite that crash-landed in northwest Canada in 1977. It contained a nuclear reactor, thus requiring extensive cleanup, under the Convention on International Liability for Damage Caused by Space Objects. Much more complicated have been orbital anti-satellite weapon testing by China and Russia (as recently as 2021), which left debris fields numbering in the thousands of fragments, regularly threatening the crews of the ISS.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The U.S. private sector at present needs to register new satellites through the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Federal Communication Commission (for the frequency used by that satellite), and the International Telecommunications Union (if utilizing a GEO slot). Requests for a more streamlined registration system are under consideration, but the continuing expansion of private sector launch capabilities (in response to the increasing financial rewards within that sector) and ongoing orbital weapons testing suggest the need for a more structured response to orbital space development by both governments and private enterprise. And as the World Economic Forum noted in its 2022 &lt;i&gt;Global Risks Report&lt;/i&gt;, “increased space activity could also lead to unknown environmental impacts or raise costs of public goods such as weather-monitoring or climate change surveillance.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Clearly this is an arena demanding more care and attention than it is currently getting. Hard-charging national governments and multinational corporations appear to be more focused on political and economic advantage than on concerns for the future viability of humankind in space and the risks and downsides emerging within that sector.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Future Impacts in Renewable Resources Industries</title>
 <link>https://www.aaiforesight.com/blog/future-impacts-renewable-resources-industries</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-picture-for-slideshow field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-and-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.aaiforesight.com/sites/default/files/styles/rectangle-368px-wide/public/sawdust-g4c6a348b7_640.jpg?itok=9PcL1Ue4&quot; width=&quot;368&quot; height=&quot;245&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Sawdust is a reusable byproduct of the lumber industry.

Photo: Deborah Jackson / Pixabay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;It is a measure of the times to see economic sectors that have historically been substantial producers of byproduct waste take a hard look at what they have been ignoring. One such sector is the forest products industry, which had normally burned its sawdust—much like natural gas was initially burned off by the petroleum industry until they began storing it back underground elsewhere, initially in salt mines.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The factors driving this sea change are many, and one site of this expanded focus has been Europe, particularly Italy and Spain. In some cases, the research behind innovative uses of forest product waste is being funded by innovative and entrepreneurial companies such as &lt;a href=&quot;https://cmc-texpan.com/en/&quot; target=&quot;_&amp;quot;blank&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;CMC Texpan&lt;/a&gt;  in Italy and &lt;a href=&quot;https://honextmaterial.com/&quot; target=&quot;_&amp;quot;blank&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;HONEXT&lt;/a&gt;  in Spain (versus, for example, the national lab systems in the U.S.).  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In Colzate, Italy, Texpan utilized the first half of 2020 (during the COVID shutdown) to introduce a new processing technology called &lt;a href=&quot;https://cmc-texpan.com/en/news/220-cmc-texpan-presents-lynx-an-effective-solution-for-detecting-and-removing-contaminants-from-wood-particles&quot; target=&quot;_&amp;quot;blank&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Lynx&lt;/a&gt; (based on SWIR spectroscopy), which automatically identifies and removes contaminants and pollutants—such as plastics, foam, silicone, and polystyrene—from recycled wood-based products, as well as wood waste, chips, and particles. The technology is projected to address higher density materials such as ferrous and nonferrous metals, aluminum, copper, lead, and a range of alloys using X-ray and color-sensing systems. The development of a consolidated inspection line is expected to meet some of the challenges of rapidly diminishing fresh wood resources that is facing Europe. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In contrast to the Italian approach, the Barcelona company focuses on the waste stream from paper production. The driver for HONEXT is a combination of its forecast of raw material supply being outrun by product demand in the coming decades and its identification of a usable pulp and paper industry waste product. Specifically, the residue recovered from the wastewater stream (termed sludge) has historically been sent to landfills. As well, corrugated cardboard, or OCC, utilized for packing and packaging, has been a growing material resource, in part because of the substantial surge of online shopping and shipping. In this case, the Universitat Politecrica de Catalunya in Barcelona spun out HONEXT, which utilizes a new waste reclaiming technology that turns cellulose residue into a construction-ready material (for example, medium density fiberboard, or MDF, with a combination of 75% paper sludge and 25% cardboard waste).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The process is resin free and accomplished without CO2 emissions, resulting in a new range of products that are nontoxic, long lasting, and sustainable. This nonlinear process uses a circular economic model of waste collection to material generation that could be termed &lt;i&gt;cradle to cradle&lt;/i&gt;, thus falling into line with environmental, social, and governance (ESG) standards. The ideal will be the development of distributed production networks, where waste is transformed to product at the point of waste generation.  &lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Solar and Renewable Power in 2021</title>
 <link>https://www.aaiforesight.com/blog/solar-and-renewable-power-2021</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-picture-for-slideshow field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-and-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.aaiforesight.com/sites/default/files/styles/rectangle-368px-wide/public/solar-farm-4683339_1280.jpg?itok=aGHk_EYF&quot; width=&quot;368&quot; height=&quot;194&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Solar farm by Christo Ras/Pixabay&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-holder&quot; style=&quot;width:368px; max-width:100% !important;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Solar farm by Christo Ras/Pixabay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Once a year I try to check in on renewable power issues, and I believe that solar has the most potential but faces the most challenges. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) reports that 43% of new energy capacity added in the United States in 2020 came from solar—the greatest annual increase to date. This additional capacity added up to 19.2 gigawatts (GW), and new installations coming over the next decade will be close to 325 GW,  SEIA estimates.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A related element in this expansion is the repurposing of brownfields:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Near Houston, a 240-acre site scheduled to be online by the end of 2022 will be the largest repurposed solar site in the U.S. As a public–private endeavor between the city of Houston and Sunnyside Energy, it combines climate action initiatives and community building for underserved urban communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In Healdsburg, California, a new floating solar facility sited on water treatment ponds at the city wastewater plant is the largest floating plant constructed in the U.S. to date.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;In West Texas, the Danish company Ørsted, using Chinese PV panels, has just completed a 1.3 million panel installation on a 3,600-acre site in the Permian shale basin.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These are heady growth figures, but logistic challenges continue to accompany ground-level solar farms and urban rooftop installations. One critical challenge that affects other renewable energy arenas, including wind power (and oil and gas as well—especially offshore) is the continued health, safety, and operational viability of workers in what has been a work theater marked by accidents, injuries, and work-related illnesses. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the COVID pandemic expanding those levels of risk, steady growth in the overall energy arena has not been guaranteed over the past 20+ months. Offsetting these challenges, however, is the expansion of remote medicine and emergency response in the renewable energy field, where installations can be sited in relatively rural and remote areas, such as offshore sites, without additional risk to site staff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In spite of these increases in decarbonization, fossils fuels continue to supply more than 80% of global energy demands, as the scale and cost of decarbonizing the global energy system remain quite significant. The share of fossil fuels in the world’s total energy mix is still as high as a decade ago, despite the falling cost of renewables and pressure on governments to act on climate change, according to a report by green energy policy network REN21. Use of fossil fuels continues to be driven by rising global energy demand, continued investment in new fossil fuel plants, and lower use of biomass energy—such as wood or agricultural waste—in heating and cooking. Although China recently announced it will not build new coal-fired energy plants anywhere in the world, it is just one player in the global energy industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Energy-intensive sectors—including power, transport, heavy industry, and buildings—are increasing their decarbonization efforts, driven by increasing government and consumer demand for rapid reductions in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions. Bloomberg NEF notes that achieving net-zero emissions will require between $92 trillion and $173 trillion in infrastructure investments in the energy sector alone, between now and 2050.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And even small gains in flexibility, efficiency, or capacity in clean energy and low-carbon industry could lead to trillions of dollars in value and savings. As electricity supplies more sectors and applications, ramping up renewable energy deployment to decarbonize the globally expanding power sector can mean more power is supplied by intermittent sources (such as solar and wind), creating new demand for forecasting, coordination, and flexible consumption capability to ensure that power grids can be operated safely and reliably. Accordingly, transition to low-carbon energy systems will drive a rapid growth of distributed power generation, distributed storage, and advanced demand-response capabilities, which need to be orchestrated and integrated through more networked, transactional power grids.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One strategy for meeting these challenges is the continuing growth in the use of artificial intelligence (AI) in managing and developing alternative energy applications—and the potential for increasing decarbonization worldwide. Navigating these trends presents huge strategic and operational challenges to the energy system and to energy-intensive industries. And this is where AI can create an intelligent coordination layer across the generation, transmission, and use of energy. AI can help energy-system stakeholders identify patterns and insights in data, learn from experience to improve system performance over time, and predict and model possible outcomes of complex, multivariate situations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;AI applications are already driving measurable improvements in renewable energy forecasting, grid operations and optimization, coordination of distributed energy assets, and demand-side management, plus materials innovation and discovery. However, while AI’s application in the energy sector has been promising so far, AI innovation and adoption remain slower than initially anticipated. While that is frustrating, increased AI enhancement presents the opportunity to accelerate the transition toward the zero-emission, highly efficient, and interconnected energy systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This would include&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;adopting best practices for sustainable computing designed to limit the carbon footprint of AI,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;focusing AI development on usability and interpretability,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;establishing data standards, data-sharing mechanisms, and platforms to increase the availability and quality of data,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;empowering consumers and the energy workforce with a human-centered AI approach designed to match technology and skill development,&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;implementing compatible software standards and interoperable interfaces to manage the risks presented by AI, and&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;ensuring that ethics and responsible use are at the core of development and deployment.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given the urgent need to scale up a global energy transition, we can’t afford to leave any tools in the toolbox. Used well, AI will accelerate the energy transition while expanding access to energy services, encouraging innovation, and ensuring a safe, resilient, and affordable clean energy system. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is not to say, however, that AI technology can replace an essential need for aggressive political, corporate, and NGO commitment to reducing emissions worldwide at an increasing rate if the climate crisis is going to be met and successfully managed in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>AI as Tyrant</title>
 <link>https://www.aaiforesight.com/blog/ai-tyrant</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-picture-for-slideshow field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-and-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.aaiforesight.com/sites/default/files/styles/rectangle-368px-wide/public/robot-2301646_640sized.jpg?itok=GzevFnd_&quot; width=&quot;368&quot; height=&quot;207&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Computerizer / Pixabay&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-holder&quot; style=&quot;width:368px; max-width:100% !important;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Computerizer / Pixabay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Not too long ago I wrote about &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.aaiforesight.com/blog/management-ai&quot; target=&quot;_&amp;quot;blank&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;the growing use of AI as a management tool&lt;/a&gt; to oversee online customer relations workers and human–robot relations in areas such as warehousing. Since that time, more information has come to light about moving AI decision making up the organizational ladder into human resources, including hiring and firing, and into other arenas, such as decision making in combat arenas. While these trends clearly reduce middle management workload, questions have arisen about the functionality and viability in this growing area of AI responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well, human oversight in these types of decisions has declined, resulting in the decline of review and appeal options for workers. This has also been true for outside suppliers for companies such as Amazon, where vendor relationships can be ended without a review of charges filed against them, largely because of a conviction at top management levels that “machines make decisions more quickly and accurately than people, reducing costs and giving Amazon a competitive advantage.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One area of worker conflict is the Flex delivery service, where AI algorithms focus on meeting schedules and delivery goals, without consideration of real-world challenges, such as locked delivery areas, packages unavailable for pickup, or vehicle breakdowns. This was based on a top management decision that it was “cheaper to trust the algorithms than pay people to investigate mistaken firings, so long as the drivers could be replaced easily.” And this is combined with minimal real-time in-the-field problem-solving support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the case of the Department of Defense, its autonomous weapon policy has been to allow commanders and operators to exercise appropriate levels of human judgment over the use of force, but this guideline has not been updated since November 2012. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other side of the question is whether a human can or should make every decision about the use of lethal force—especially when hundreds of decisions are required simultaneously. And there is a strong belief among military planners and policy makers that rapid changes in AI capability will allow high reliability landmark and target identification for effective robotic self-control—in the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But this has not always been the case, as built-in bias in algorithms can lead to unexpected outcomes. While it is easy to say that AI will be constantly improved over time, the unanswered questions remain: Who will be doing those improvements, the AIs themselves? And for what purposes, cost savings or quality performance? At Amazon, the possibility of the review of personnel decisions by AI is reaching the vanishing point, while the possibility of human review of AI drone decisions is moving in that same direction. Neither of these trends is a comforting one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Accordingly, MIT professor Max Tegmark argues that AI weapons should be “stigmatized and barred, like biologic weapons,” based on a belief that they are likely to fall into terrorist hands, with disastrous consequences worldwide.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Management by AI</title>
 <link>https://www.aaiforesight.com/blog/management-ai</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-picture-for-slideshow field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-and-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.aaiforesight.com/sites/default/files/styles/rectangle-368px-wide/public/ai-monitoring-3262759_cropped.jpg?itok=DBxFBCM8&quot; width=&quot;368&quot; height=&quot;368&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; title=&quot;Sujin Soman / Pixabay&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-holder&quot; style=&quot;width:368px; max-width:100% !important;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;Sujin Soman / Pixabay&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;The idea of an animated talking head on a screen giving your annual review may sound fanciful, but AIs (of a sort) have been making headway in the worker oversight arena for a number of years. MetLife customer service representatives have been getting an ongoing review in real time in their screen corner with icons prompting them to “slow down speech,” “increase empathy,” and “up energy levels” (with a coffee cup) developed by &lt;a href=&quot;https://cogitocorp.com/&quot; target=&quot;_&amp;quot;blank&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Cogito&lt;/a&gt;. In Silicon Valley, the company &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.percolata.com/&quot; target=&quot;_&amp;quot;blank&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Percolata&lt;/a&gt; has been offering in-store sensor systems for retail companies like 7-Eleven (formerly Southland Corporation) that gauge productivity for each employee in stores where it is installed and then order-ranks them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The outsourcing of payroll, employee scheduling, and even performance reviews is no longer new (especially for middle management), but the move to real-time oversight for what are termed “9-to-5” jobs is still getting pushback from employees—such as for door delivery services that monitor when employees are given tips and automatically add them into wage totals. In response, employers have pointed out that customer thank-you’s, empathy for claimants, and general slacking are within their realm of oversight responsibility.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But shifting responsibility for hiring over to AIs (such as scanning résumés for keywords) is still an area of contention, except where innovative approaches from companies like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.pymetrics.ai/&quot; target=&quot;_&amp;quot;blank&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Pymetrics&lt;/a&gt;, which offers a game-based tool that directly tests an applicant’s job skills (versus accepting skills claimed on a résumé), actually improves the process. Eliminating human bias makes sense, but the move to almost constant vigilance and analysis has not always been well received.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is to be expected when one takes a look at how “efficiency expert” AIs can perceive patterns that no human supervisor could: How many seconds between contacts in a call center? How long at the coffee machine? Could a different delivery route shave off a minute or two, with one more package a day delivered? One analyst noted that, “as these little breaks and minor freedoms get optimized out, the jobs are becoming more intense, stressful, and dangerous.” International worker surveys reveal less traditional anxiety about whether robots will replace them but more anxiety about what kind of boss the new AI manager will be.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Similar changes are occurring throughout the retail industry. For instance, retail workers no longer stand around in stores waiting for customers. With e-commerce, their roles are split: Some work in warehouses, where they fulfill orders nonstop, and others work in call centers, where they answer question after question. In both spaces, workers are subject to intense surveillance. Their every action is tracked by warehouse scanners and call center computers, which provide the data for the automated systems that keep them working at maximum capacity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In call centers, management apps can allow as little as 30 minutes total per month for bathroom breaks and personal time, while handling calls from people dealing with terminal illnesses, dying relatives, miscarriages, and other traumatic events are supposed to be completed in averages of less than 12 minutes, for 10 hours a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In some programming jobs, workers are expected to make at least 150 keystrokes every 10 minutes, so if one paused to think and stopped typing, a 10-minute chunk of his or her time card would be marked “idle.” Each week, if a programmer didn’t work 40 hours that the program deemed productive, he or she could be fired, so a common practice has developed of working an extra 10 hours as a safety net.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Like the efficiency experts of the 1950s, AI time/quality management is sweeping corporate America. Without looking at the customer experience or the health and morale of the workers, it makes perfect sense: The numbers show productivity equals profits and profits equal (usually) stock value. However, the wonderful thing about Western democracies is political pushback, which appears to be gathering steam, with Amazon as a focus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At Amazon warehouses, almost every aspect of management is directed by software, from how fast people work to whether they get fired for falling behind. Every worker has a “rate,” a certain number of items they have to process per hour, and if they fail to meet it, they can in fact be automatically fired with no appeal. In one Florida warehouse, three human managers managed a workforce of more than 300, using negative AI reporting to personally encourage workers to work faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“It’s like leaving your house and just running and not stopping for 10 straight hours, just running,” one worker said. Backaches, knee pain, and other symptoms of constant strain are common enough for Amazon to install painkiller vending machines in its warehouses. Workers often burn out, but because each task is minutely dictated by machine, they are easily replaced. One worker who quit a Staten Island Amazon warehouse to take a job loading and unloading delivery trucks still had to deal with scanners and metrics, but those only measured whether his team was on track for the day, leaving the workers to figure out their roles and pace for themselves. As he told his co-workers, “This is like heaven.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Perhaps this would not have drawn as much attention without the issue of unions entering the scene. Unions have a long-term history of channeling worker dissatisfaction, and the AI issue is certainly generating a significant amount of it. Contributing to that is the automation of Amazon warehouses with shelving robots, which work faster than humans and thus require maximizing the humans’ physical speed to keep pace. A range of unions have taken runs at organizing various Amazon locations, and the company response has been quite aggressive, from suggesting that voting in favor of unionization was grounds for firing to calling union organizers “a cancer within the organization.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While these tough tactics have been successful to date, the future of union focus on AI management is still foggy, but likely to be a highly combative one.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Book Review: Motti’s Transformational Journey into the Future</title>
 <link>https://www.aaiforesight.com/blog/book-review-motti%E2%80%99s-transformational-journey-future</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-picture-for-slideshow field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-and-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.aaiforesight.com/sites/default/files/styles/rectangle-368px-wide/public/Motti%20book%202.jpg?itok=WDF9Q_Ru&quot; width=&quot;368&quot; height=&quot;315&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-holder&quot; style=&quot;width:368px; max-width:100% !important;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;Victor V. Motti “fell” into future studies from an initial intention to pursue a career in engineering, he tells readers at the opening of &lt;i&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.cambridgescholars.com/product/978-1-5275-3097-3&quot; target=&quot;_&amp;quot;blank&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;A Transformation Journey to Creative and Alternative Planetary Futures&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/i&gt; Motti is now an international writer, speaker, foresight adviser and, since 2017, the director of the World Futures Studies Federation. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;His is a compelling story, especially for someone like myself, who started out as an attorney and ended up president of the World Future Society. In my own mind, the transformative nature of foresight is almost irresistible, as the field appears to relate to almost every other area of study. Accordingly, this book’s expansive title accurately describes futures as an area of lifelong study.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Motti’s encounter with the writings of leading pioneers in the futures field continued to nudge him away from engineering, as he discovered the cross-disciplinary relevances and possibilities available to a foresight student and to the practitioner. As Dr. Tom Lombardo observes in his preface to this book, the story of the author’s journey is one of infectious curiosity and imagination, augmented by an ongoing series of meetings with organizations and individuals who “helped him along his way.” I am especially sympathetic with Motti’s move from the sciences into the humanities and with his growing interest in binary approaches to the “way the world works.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One appealing aspect of the book is its author’s willingness to explore the concept of futures in other cultures (and languages besides English) as an active step toward making the “planetary” element of the title meaningful. The range of Middle Eastern and other attitudes are quite interesting and add value to the discussions. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another quite energizing area of discussion is how the cross-disciplinary nature of the future is actually playing out, such as in the converging technologies usually defined as nanotech, biotech, infotech, and cognitive technology (NBIC). As futurist Paul Saffo has recently noted, the most disruptive innovations involve not a single new technology but a half dozen of them colliding at the same time in the same arena.1 One example is the rapidly expanding area of nootropics, where drugs, supplements, and nutraceuticals are being developed to improve cognition, memory, intelligence, motivation, attention, and concentration. The book offers fascinating insights on how these technologies will change the nature of being human.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially interesting in the context of how to reduce violence in humans and the frictions between cultures, with the goal of moving toward a planetary outlook. Motti does a thorough, systemic analysis of the factors involved and how to better understand them, which could prove useful when examining the often unrecognized cultural gulfs between East and West and their impact on planetary dynamics. But the discussion goes far beyond the binary cliché of Eastern interdependence versus Western independence and examines how these gulfs could be better identified and addressed. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One very promising arena Motti addresses is the expansion of artificial intelligence and virtual reality. including their impacts on education and communications and on human cognition and capabilities.  This is especially relevant in light of the human brain’s neuroplasticity and its ability to rewire itself in response to new challenges (and opportunities). &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, Motti addresses the shifting of gender roles, an area of foresight that does not get enough attention. He examines the relatively greater robustness of female immune systems and gender variations of neural wiring, leading to varied strengths in areas of cognition. This then yields a fascinating discussion of the future of work and culture, as the binary balances between genders shift.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book closes with a discussion of foresight approaches to the modeling of complex systems, with a broad range of model examples. This is a strength evident throughout the book, where sections addressing foresight projects under discussion are often illuminated with charts and the relevant formulas used in their calculations. All in all, this is a very strong and informative book.&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>Electric Power in the Future</title>

I do not mean &lt;i&gt;systems thinking&lt;/i&gt; as a discrete discipline in itself, which has had its ups and downs over the years, but instead as a through understanding of logistic structures and cross-disciplinary dynamics. In this context, it is also the case that engineering (especially electrical engineering) has not always had a significant voice in setting policy on renewable energy systems development, especially in the United States. This is in part true because the congressional policy arena has been dominated for decades by the fossil fuel industry, which has had little or no interest in the successful development and marketplace expansion of renewables.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One example is the question of what the impact would be on the North American electric grid and its infrastructure if all U.S. buildings and most American vehicles were fully electrified. Would the load on this national infrastructure be overwhelming, and would the cost of power soar, generating economic catastrophe? This has been an insistent argument of the natural gas industry, which in the face of the declining vitality of the coal and other branches of the petroleum industry has become the most viable opponent of renewable power.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And what do we now mean by &lt;i&gt;renewables?&lt;/i&gt; In the past, this has mainly meant wind and solar power. Those opposed stated with certainty that these resources would never match fossil fuels in terms of cost and efficiency, but does this continue to be true? One of the more interesting battlegrounds in this “heated” debate has been the state of New York, where utilities have insistently pushed for more gas pipelines and expanded gas infrastructure across the state for several decades. And interestingly, a significant portion of this debate is not now centering on solar panels or wind turbines, but instead on heat-pump technology and, most often, on ground-source heat pumps.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That technology has taken astounding leaps forward in the last few years. At present, new air-source heat pumps are now independently rated at twice to three times more efficient than gas furnaces, and ground-source heat pumps are proving three to five times more efficient than gas. As well, new construction standards such as passive and net-zero heating operating in complement with local regulation (such as higher levels of insulation) have improved new building envelopes while meeting tighter local emission standards.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As implied, these U.S. regulatory shifts are not at the national level, where fossil fuel interests continue to hold the U.S. Congress in thrall (one example is the lax U.S. regulation of fracking). These new local regulations seldom favor the fossil fuel industry, but do favor geothermal technology, which has emerged as a real contender. In Canada, the dialogue &lt;i&gt;has&lt;/i&gt; reached the federal level, and fuel switching and building retrofits are now becoming increasingly acceptable across North America. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In comparison, Sweden’s federal program of educational encouragement and regulatory support has been in place for several decades. The result was a national shift in the use of heating oil from 9,000,000 cubic meters in 1975 to 500,000 cubic meters in 2014, in line with the nation’s increased federal restrictions on greenhouse gas emissions. This program of incentives and training (including both builders and homeowners) began in 1994 and has resulted in between 40 and 70 percent of new HVAC (heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning) systems being heat-pump based. Now, over 50 percent of Swedish homes are heated by heat pumps, mostly ground-source based.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What is interesting in the Swedish case study is that national electric use did &lt;i&gt;not&lt;/i&gt; surge, but in fact went down nearly 30 percent over the above 20-year period (1994-2014), in part due to increases in heat-pump efficiencies. As a result, Sweden’s dependence on imported oil decreased significantly over the same period. This rather dramatic decrease in petroleum use and related energy costs, as a result of the national decision in Sweden to shift energy reliance on fossil fuels, happened in a society somewhat different from the United States. But these are policy matters, and not engineering ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From the engineering viewpoint, electric power patterns are clearly shifting. It is true that a massive increase in electric vehicles in the U.S. could theoretically put a nearly one trillion kilowatt additional demand on the national electric grid (about 20 percent of its present total capacity). But it is also clear that no dramatic shift will occur in the near future. In the past, electric cars required a national vehicle charging network to make them viable, much as the South Korean government mandated in the early 2000s. The capacity of the North American grid is not frozen in time, however, nor is the demand. As some use levels increase, others will decline.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is especially true in terms of rooftop solar (also a localized dynamic). The cost of solar panels and related battery storage—which lessens the dependence on sunny days—will continue to drop significantly worldwide. This is enhanced by power-generating windows and coatings, and the consequence of this is the growing category of self-contained and energy-positive buildings, both new and retrofitted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As well, load-optimization software is helping energy planners keep up with the shifting electricity landscape. One area of optimization has been the concentration of ground-source-based heat pumps in new developments, where the use of microgrid-management software helps reduce the number of ground bore holes necessary per house.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another factor driving the shift to energy efficiencies and renewables is the growing number of enterprises like Alphabet X’s [Google] &lt;a href=&quot;https://dandelionenergy.com/press-release/launch/&quot; target=&quot;_&amp;quot;blank&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Dandelion Energy&lt;/a&gt;  endeavor, which focuses on ground-based heat-pump installations. Although ground-based heat pumps are still more restrictively regulated in many areas than gas hookups, that seems to be changing, despite the continuing costs of installing the related loop assets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Increasingly efficient home batteries and personal car chargers can also enable successful power sharing at peak load times from rooftop solar, often with a net gain to the local homeowner. As well, the lifetime cost of home electric management and electric vehicles will continue to drop in many regions of the world, with electric cars ahead of fossil fuel vehicles on that front. New power generation plants are also proving to be increasingly renewable, with the cost of coal and nuclear power now considered far too high to be competitive. And in addition are local/state legislation such as the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.commerce.wa.gov/growing-the-economy/energy/ceta/&quot; target=&quot;_&amp;quot;blank&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Washington Clean Energy Transformation Act&lt;/a&gt;, which prohibits electric utilities in Washington state from supplying power from coal-fired utilities. Truly, renewables are coming into their own.&lt;/p&gt;

Unfortunately, this was less than a year before he overleveraged his massive merger and acquisitions campaign and the stock value of WPP on the London Stock Exchange fell almost 80% in under a week.  Although that value did eventually recover and continue to rise until it was the largest business communications firm in the world, it is hard not to feel that Sir Martin (which he eventually became) was missing something with that statement. The question is worth considering.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Very few of us would argue that the future could ever be a mirror image of the past, simply because it never has been. It is not hard to be sympathetic with the idea that the past is much easier to pin down and examine than the future always proves to be, but the simplified image of calendar pages flipping over, one much like the other, misses the incredible increase in the levels of change in our modern world and the awesome challenge of “pinning down” the future.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the determining factors here is the increasing levels of complexity in that modern world in terms of technology, political structures, climate, ecological factors, and cultures, to name a few areas, and their many interactions. One way of expressing these patterns is moving from the laterally flipping calendar pages to rising spirals of growth and progress, or perhaps the swirling dynamics of often-chaotic world weather systems.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One clear difference between the study of the future and the study of the past is that the future teaches (for those inclined to listen) humility. The solid vision of the past tends to make its scholars overconfident (as when disagreeing over the winners or losers of wars), while the future has a shimmering and ephemeral quality that encourages more energetic and imaginative methods—and the habit of checking your data at least twice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is in part because of the energetic dynamics of the future itself: To say that it presents a moving target is putting it mildly. And the too-seldomly raised question of “whose future” we’re considering makes the study of the future all the more intimidating. While it might stretch metaphors to say that the “future is a fickle mistress,” there is little disagreement that she makes you work like a demon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The past can be reconfigured many times, depending on who is making the call, but the future seldom sits passively and waits for observers to make up their mind. And there is no denying the thrill of the pursuit!&lt;/p&gt;

 <title>On Methodology: Technology Foresight (Event Report)</title>
 <link>https://www.aaiforesight.com/blog/methodology-technology-foresight-event-report</link>
 <description>&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-field-picture-for-slideshow field-type-image field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;image-and-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;img typeof=&quot;foaf:Image&quot; src=&quot;https://www.aaiforesight.com/sites/default/files/styles/rectangle-368px-wide/public/TechForecast%20webinar.jpg?itok=PwIgR4JA&quot; width=&quot;368&quot; height=&quot;369&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; /&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;caption-holder&quot; style=&quot;width:368px; max-width:100% !important;&quot;&gt;&lt;p class=&quot;image-caption&quot;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field field-name-body field-type-text-with-summary field-label-hidden&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-items&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;field-item even&quot; property=&quot;content:encoded&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;As part of its executive education webinar series on workforce planning in the “next normal,” Vanderbilt University hosted a Zoom lecture June 23 on “Technology Foresight: Predicting and Planning for the Future” led by Professor &lt;a href=&quot;https://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/bio/andrew-vanschaack&quot; target=&quot;_&amp;quot;blank&amp;quot;&quot;&gt;Andy Van Schaack&lt;/a&gt; of the School of Engineering Management. The goal was to present futures techniques needed to redesign workforces for a new business landscape.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Van Schaack dealt with four methods of technology forecasting—Monitoring, Expert Opinion (Delphi), Trend Extrapolation, and Scenario Development—that the user could apply across an industry area of interest. While attendees had no audio or video capability during the webinar, they were able to participate in a range of interactive Zoom techniques, including polls. Participants suggested what industries they wanted the session to cover (e.g., health care, education, manufacturing, and transportation) and responded to the question of what technology would change the world the most by 2045. Suggestions included virtual reality, artificial intelligence, synthetic biology, CRISPR, blockchain, and relaunchable rockets. Van Schaack observed that AI would help create all the other technologies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;• Monitoring.&lt;/b&gt; Technology development monitoring includes surveying social and economic impacts, basic scientific findings behind technology proposals, laboratory feasibility, and operational and commercial practicality. These technology trends can be discovered from work in R&amp;amp;D labs, industry conferences (such as the Tesla battery conference), competitions (X Prize); academic journals (Google Scholar), and tech-oriented magazines &lt;i&gt;(MIT Technology Review).&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;• Delphi.&lt;/b&gt; The Expert Opinion/Delphi discussion described several approaches that aim to avoid the “wisdom of crowds” fallacy as well as the predictable irrationality of dominating experts, unresolvable disputes, and unwillingness to listen. The method consists of multiple convergence rounds (four here) of surveys, but factors such as moderator choosing experts and drafting the question still remain problematic. One solution has been moving beyond panels of academics to a full range of stakeholders from industry and impacted communities. Van Schaack suggested that the Delphi Method would be good way to get expert opinion when there is a lack of historical data, as in the case of COVID-19’s impacts on the hospitality industry.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;• Trend Extrapolation.&lt;/b&gt; Forecasting trends can be addressed by charting growth curves, inverse curves (e.g., the replacement of propeller with jet propulsion), or substitution curves (e.g., replacing horses with cars). Plus there are underlying factors, such as overlapping S-curves such as transport by canal, then rail, then road, then air.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;• Scenario Development.&lt;/b&gt; The steps for building scenarios are analyzing relevant factors (especially external forces), scenario creation using the four-cell matrix (least to most, worst to best); identification of SWOT (strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, threats) and TOWS (mapping strengths to opportunities to identify your most obvious natural priorities); and producing action plans with specific actionable recommendations for each different scenario. Attendees rated this method the most likely to be used by their own organization. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Impact and uncertainty were factors here (likely/dangerous), but those scenarios initially picked drive subsequent response plans, where variables include qualitative versus quantitative focus and the robustness of the outcomes (agreement among participants and within the four-way factor analysis). Of course the goal is to identify where trends are going versus where they have been.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The implication here is that forecasters who have had good results previously may not have productive results going forward. One solution response is a methodical process with enough transparency to allow third-party analysis, plus the presentation of results in a clear and understandable fashion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This requires disclosure to the audience of the sources of data utilized, the analytical methods involved, and the assumptions made. This sort of transparency will have an impact on how third parties respond to the forecasts. Van Schaack closed comparing forecasting to chess—you can learn the rules fairly quickly, but mastery takes a lifetime to develop.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;During the webinar’s discussion period, Van Schaack noted that there are more than a hundred approaches to forecasting, but the four described were the most common for technology forecasting. Another he said could be added is &lt;i&gt;modeling&lt;/i&gt; to understand the mechanisms underlying what’s happening. New methods are likely to be iterations of these four methods but using technology to do it better, such as AI to do the modeling using massive data, he said.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This one-hour presentation was designed for a business audience, but Van Schaack noted that his college-age students at Vanderbilt did seem to be applying the lessons learned in his class to lifelong decision making. The existence of this course in a school of engineering seems to be a sign of the acceptance of foresight as a useful tool for a range of audiences—another “Next Normal.”&lt;/p&gt;
